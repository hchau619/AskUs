# AskUs

Hello, and welcome to AskUs! AskUs is a web app designed for community decision-making.
We allow users to post all kinds of questions and issues, ranging from questions about food to
asking people what they should name their new family pet. Other users can then post responses
to these questions as well as vote on existing responses. The responses with the most votes are
brought to the top of the list, so the owner of the question can make a decision based on the
response that gets the most votes.
The following documentation will help you learn more about AskUs. We will describe how you
can download a copy of the web app on your local machine. We then go into detail about our
app and what you can do with it.
So, let's get started!

# How to Get Started
1. You can obtain a copy of the web app by cloning it from its GitHub page:
> https://github.com/hchau619/AskUs

2. Next, navigate to the project's root directory through a terminal.

3. If it is the first time you will run the app, type in “[sudo] npm install”. This will install all of the
dependencies needed for the project.

4. Then, type in "node app.js" to start the project. The default port the server will be listening on is
port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).
